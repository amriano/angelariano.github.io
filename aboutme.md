### My name is Angela, I love animals and training dogs

I have a beautiful dog named *Butter*, he is the one in the picture. I love him very much, we adopted him when he was 5 months old. *Butter* was not house trained, we as a family spend some time helping him learn to behave better inside the house.

I play and spend lots of time with *Butter*, I started to learn how to teach him new tricks, I enjoy teaching him and he loves learning, we have lots of fun together.

When I grow up I want to be a Veterinarian, I am saving the money I make training and sitting dogs to pay for college.
